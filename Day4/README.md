# Summary

Main content is currently provided solely as interactive live discussion.
We look at a few of more commonly used mathematical concepts in Data Science, such as vector spaces, probability & distributions, frequency domain, and differential calculus. Specifically, we look at those form the perspective of Data Science, and how they can be used in practice to and how we can think of them in a more intuitive way.

These notebooks are primarily for running the visualizations and the exercises.

To keep track of the topics suggested for the discussion, in this notebook is also given this list of topics:

- linear algebra (with DL in mind) - vector space:
    - vectors - linearity, basis, "good" basis, freedom of parametrization,
    - dot products - length and direction, mse
    - projection
    - matrices as list of vectors, mat mul, rotation
    - (O) basis change, pca
    - metric space - MSE
    - tensors
   
- statistical distributions
    - distributions: uniform, normal, etc; 
    - metrics: mean std mode, momenta space, AuC = 1
    - distributions proximity: Entropy, KL distance, Wasserstein distance
    - likelihood
    - number of samples in the dataset and model performance
        
- frequency domain
    - sine, cosine
    - Fourier transform
    - trends
        
- differential calculus:
    - slope
    - equilibrium - 4 types of zero
    - how to calculate the slope in practice
    - and how to use it
