It takes as input all the variables we want to be able to specify for a given animal, in this case: the name, age, species, quantity of food per day. The `has_true` parameter is optional and set to `True` by default as most animals do have fur. We see that insisde the function the parameters are saved *in* the class using the notation `self.parameter`. `self` represents the class itself hence the name.\n",
