    "3. Next, we want to analyse the **surface of the glacier**. We consider this to be the **white area** in the image. All pixels that exceed a certain **threshold** shall be considered white. So create a **mask** in which all pixels contain `True` where the pixel value is greater than 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Since we have an RGB image, there are 3 channels (red, green and blue), this also reflects in the shape of the mask created above. With `np.all()` (another aggregating function) we can apply the **mask to all 3 channels together** to extract the white area. More precisely it means that we generate a 2D boolean image that is only `True` where the values are **above the threshold in all 3 channels**. You can then show the result with `plt.imshow()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Hint: use `white = np.all(mask, axis=-1)`*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. (Optional) In many scientific contexts, it is crucial whether **ice areas have a certain minimum size**. To extract these, we can remove small, unconnected areas. We can use the function `skimage.morphology.opening()` for this purpose (for details, see below). Again display the result.\n",

    "    *Hint: use `skimage.morphology.opening(white)`*\n",

    "6. Now split the extracted boolean snow image into a **part showing 2021 and one for 2022**, respectively (just create 2 crops along the middle and save them in variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Calculate the **area of the glacier** in 2021 and 2022 by counting the number of pixels that are `True` in the respective images. You can simply use `np.sum()` for this. Print it and make a **conclusion about the change** in the glacier area.\n",

    "*Details on `skimage.morphology.opening()`: This function first removes a few pixels from the edge of all areas and then adds the same number of pixels to the result. The effect is that small areas are deleted because after the pixels have been removed there is no area left to which pixels could be added again. The result is a **mask** that only contains areas with a certain minimum size. Even more information you can find in the [documentation](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.morphology.html#skimage.morphology.opening)*"
